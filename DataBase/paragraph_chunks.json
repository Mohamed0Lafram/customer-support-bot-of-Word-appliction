{"id":4298,"text":"A database consists of a number of fields that contain the individual pieces of data, which in turn can be organized in records and then into tables. Unlike Calc spreadsheets, database tables cannot have formulas and when creating a table, you also determine the characteristics of each field within it (text, characters, integer numbers, floating point numbers, binary data, etc\u2026)."}
{"id":4300,"text":"Forms are documents created for data entry into the fields of one or more tables which have been associated with the form. For example, when you enter your data in a web service, you are using a form. Forms can also be used for viewing fields from one or more tables associated with the form."}
{"id":4302,"text":"A query creates a new table from the existing tables. A query extract data from tables given a specific search criteria you define."}

The JRE is not installed in Base by default. Please go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Advanced to select a JRE from those installed on your computer."}
{"id":4307,"text":"Base can create both flat and relational databases, and it can create databases where fields have relationships with each other."}
{"id":4309,"text":"A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all the records are stored as single rows of data. The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file, CSV file or spreadsheet."}
{"id":4311,"text":"A relational database (RDB) is a collective set of multiple data sets organized by tables, records and columns (fields). RDBs establish a well-defined relationship between database tables. Tables communicate and share information, which facilitates data searchability, organization and reporting. Base use Structured Query Language (SQL), a standard user application that provides an easy programming interface for database interaction."}
{"id":4312,"text":"For example: Consider a database that lists a CD music collection. It will contain fields for the names of the artists and a field that holds the CD title. While there is an obvious relationship between the artist and the CD they have created, the CD collection may contain more than one CD by the same artist. These are one-to-many relationships: many artists are linked to more than one CD, so this database contains multiple one-to-many relationships. However, the record company database can contain the names of the artist plus other fields like artist agent. The relationship between artist and agent is one to one: only one agent for each artist."}
{"id":4313,"text":"If you are acquainted with mathematical sets, a relational database can easily be explained in terms of sets: elements, subsets, unions, and intersections. The fields of a database are the elements and the tables are subsets. Relationships within databases are defined in terms of unions and intersections of the subsets (tables)."}
{"id":4315,"text":"Databases exist to organize data for easy and accurate retrieval. Database tables are much stricter to define and create, therefore planning in advance is necessary. In this chapter, we will show you how to plan a database. In our example, we will create a database that contains automobile expenses."}
{"id":4316,"text":"The first step in creating a database is to define it by determining what fields are needed. In this case, we will ask a series of questions about the data:"}
{"id":4318,"text":"Information is needed on three broad areas: fuel usage, maintenance, and vacation."}
{"id":4319,"text":"What input data is required for the output?"}
{"id":4322,"text":"Date purchased, odometer reading, fuel cost, fuel quantity, and payment method for it."}
{"id":4323,"text":"(Fuel economy need not be included, as it can be calculated using a query.)"}
{"id":4325,"text":"Date of service, odometer reading, type of service, cost of service, and next scheduled service of this type (for example, for oil changes, list when the next oil change should be). A field for notes was added to the list."}
{"id":4327,"text":"Date, odometer reading, fuel (including all the fields of the fuel table), food (including meals and snacks), motel, total tolls, and miscellaneous. These purchases are made by one of two bank cards or cash, so we will need a field to state which payment type was used for each item."}
{"id":4329,"text":"Breakfast, lunch, supper, and snacks seem to fit. Should all the snacks be listed individually or list the total cost for snacks for the day? In this case, the snacks are divided into two fields: number of snacks and total cost of snacks, and a payment type is also needed for breakfast, lunch, supper, and total cost of snacks."}
{"id":4330,"text":"What are the fields that are common to more than one area?"}
{"id":4331,"text":"Date appears in multiple areas, as does odometer reading and payment type."}
{"id":4332,"text":"How will these fields be used to get the required information?"}
{"id":4333,"text":"While on vacation, the expenses for each day will be listed together. These date fields suggest a relationship between the vacation table and the dates in the fuel and food tables, so the date fields in these tables will be linked when the database is created."}
{"id":4334,"text":"These payments type will include two bank cards and cash. So a table will be created with a field for the type of payment and use it in list boxes in the forms."}
{"id":4335,"text":"After the fields for the database tables have been listed, we will need a field for the primary key, which is an identifier that is unique to each record. Some of the tables already have a suitable field for the primary key but an additional field for the primary key must be created for other fields (like payment type)."}
{"id":4336,"text":"If a table does not have a primary key field, any data that is added, deleted, or modified must be done with the Execute SQL Statement dialog (Tools > SQL\u2026)."}

{"id":4352,"text":"When you create a database, you should save your work regularly. This means you should save the whole database as well."}
{"id":4353,"text":"For example, when you create your first table, you must save it before you can close it. This makes it part of the database in memory. But only when you save the database file that the table is written to disk."}
{"id":4354,"text":"All database files in Open Document Format are stored with the *.odb extension. Files in that format contain all elements of the database, including forms, reports, tables, and the data itself. The same format can also store a connection to an external database server instead of the local data, for example, to access a MySQL or PostgreSQL database server in your network."}
{"id":4356,"text":"Database tables store information in a group of things called fields. For example, a table will use fields to hold the data in an address book, a stock list, a phone book, or a price list. A database must have at least one table and will probably have have multiple tables."}
{"id":4357,"text":"Each field can hold data of a single type. For example, an address book that contains phone numbers would contain phone numbers in fields that are the Phone type. Similarly, a price list table might contain two fields: Name and Price. The Name field would contain the names of the items; the Price field would contain the amount of each item."}

{"id":4389,"text":"Since Base requires you to specify the maximum length of each field on creation, make sure you make each field as large or maybe larger than necessary. By default, Base uses the VARCHAR format for a text field, so it will only use the number of characters necessary for the field even if it takes up less space than than the limit. So when a field uses VARCHAR, a field that contains 20 characters will only take up 20 characters in the database, even if the limit for the field is set at 100. In contrast, a text field with the CHAR text format has a fixed length and that field will be 100 characters long even if the actual length is 1 or 100."}
{"id":4390,"text":"Each field has a Field type, which must be specified. Types include text, integer, date, and decimal. If the field is going to have general information in it (for example, a name or a description), use text. If the field will always contain a number (for example, a price), the type should be decimal or another numerical field. The wizard picks the right field type, so to get an idea of how this works, see what the wizard has chosen for different fields."}
{"id":4391,"text":"Since up and down arrows are available on this page (not shown in Figure 248), you can use these to reorder the list of fields. Also + and \u2013 buttons are available and you can use these to remove fields from the list or to add new fields."}

{"id":6574,"text":"Listing 3: Code recorded for the EnterMyname macro"}
{"id":6576,"text":"All comments in Basic macro coding begin with REM, which stands for remark. All text on a line that begins with REM is ignored by the Basic interpreter when the macro is run."}
{"id":6577,"text":"As a shortcut, you can use the single quote character (') to start a comment."}
{"id":6578,"text":"LibreOffice Basic is not case-sensitive for keywords, so REM, Rem, and rem can all start a comment. If you use symbolic constants defined by the Application Programming Interface (API), it is safer to assume that the names are case-sensitive. It is worth noting that symbolic constants are an advanced topic that is not covered by this user guide and they are not required when using the macro recorder in LibreOffice."}
{"id":6580,"text":"Individual macros are stored in subroutines and these subroutines begin with the keyword SUB. The end of a subroutine is indicated by the words END SUB. The code starts by defining the subroutine named Main, which is empty and does nothing. Note that the code in Listing 3 for the EnterMyName macro starts with the keyword SUB and ends with END SUB."}
{"id":6581,"text":"There are advanced topics that are beyond the scope of this user guide, but knowing about them might be of interest:"}
{"id":6582,"text":"You can write subroutines that accept input values to be used inside the macro. These values are called arguments. This can only be done when you create subroutines from scratch. Recorded macros in LibreOffice do not accept arguments."}
{"id":6583,"text":"Another kind of subroutine is called a function, which is a subroutine that can return a value as a result of its work. Functions are defined by the keyword FUNCTION at the beginning. Recorded macros in LibreOffice create subroutines only."}
{"id":6585,"text":"When you are defining a variable (which contains data), you should use the DIM keyword, which was originally stood for Dimension and was used to define the dimensions of an array. The DIM statement used in the EnterMyName macro is similar to setting aside a piece of paper to be used to store a message or note."}
{"id":6586,"text":"In the EnterMyName macro, the variables document and dispatcher are defined as the type object. Other common variable types include string, integer, and date. A third variable, named args1, is an array of property values. A variable of type array allows a single variable to contain multiple values, similar to storing multiple pages in a single book. Values in an array usually begin at zero. The number in the parentheses indicates the highest usable number to access a storage location. In this example, there is only one value, and it is numbered zero."}
{"id":6588,"text":"The following is an explanation of the code used in the EnterMyName macro."}
{"id":6592,"text":"Defines document as an object variable. Objects are a specific variable type with multiple fields (sometimes they are called properties) and actions (also they are called methods). The fields can be perceived like variables (including an object) and actions like subroutines which allow us to operate with the object."}
{"id":6593,"text":"Sometimes the word service is used. A service is supplied by an object when a macro commands it via an object\u2019s method."}
{"id":6597,"text":"ThisComponent is a runtime object created by LibreOffice that refers to the current document."}
{"id":6598,"text":"CurrentController is a property referring to a service that controls the document. For example, when you type, it is the current controller that takes note of what you type. CurrentController then dispatches the changes to the document frame."}
{"id":6599,"text":"Frame is a controller property that returns the main frame for a document. Therefore, the variable named document refers to a document\u2019s frame, which receives dispatched commands."}
{"id":6601,"text":"Most tasks in LibreOffice are accomplished by dispatching a command. LibreOffice includes a DispatchHelper service, which provides an easy way to dispatch a URL using one call instead of multiple ones and does most of the work when using dispatches in macros. The method CreateUnoService accepts the name of a service and it tries to create an instance of that service. On completion, the dispatcher variable contains a reference to a DispatchHelper."}
{"id":6603,"text":"Declares the args1 array of properties. Each property has a name and a value. In other words, it is a name\/value pair. The created array has one property at index zero."}
{"id":6604,"text":"The com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue expression is a Universal Network Objects (UNO) structure. Structures are special variable types that contain other variables united by logical basis. They can be convenient to operate with sets of heterogeneous information that should be treated as a single whole."}
{"id":6605,"text":"An explanation of UNO and user structures goes far beyond the scope of this book. For more information on creating and using structures, see the LibreOffice Help system and other Basic guides."}
{"id":6607,"text":"Gives the property the name \u201cText\u201d and the value \u201cYour name\u201d, which is the text that is inserted when the macro is run."}
{"id":6609,"text":"The dispatch helper sends a dispatch to the document frame (stored in the variable document) with the command .uno:InsertText. The next two arguments, frame name and search flags, are beyond the scope of this book. The last argument is the array of property values to be used while executing the command InsertText."}
{"id":6610,"text":"In other words, this line of code executes the UNO command .uno:InsertText passing the value \u201cYour Name\u201d as the \u201cText\u201d parameter."}
{"id":6612,"text":"The last line of the code ends the subroutine."}
{"id":6614,"text":"When creating a macro, it is important to ask two questions before recording:"}
{"id":6615,"text":"Can the task be written as a simple set of commands?"}
{"id":6616,"text":"Can the steps be arranged so that the macro\u2019s final command leaves the cursor ready for the next command? Or does it allow the user to return to entering text or data into the target document?"}
{"id":6618,"text":"Since it is not convenient to repeatedly run macros using Tools > Macros > Run Macro, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to quickly trigger it. To assign the shortcut Ctrl+K to your macro, do the following:"}
{"id":6619,"text":"Go to Tools > Customize. This will open the Customize dialog."}
{"id":6620,"text":"Select the Keyboard tab. In the Shortcut Keys section, select the Ctrl+K shortcut."}
{"id":6621,"text":"In the Category section, select LibreOffice macros. Navigate this section and select your macro."}
{"id":6622,"text":"Now click the Assign button to assign the Ctrl+K shortcut to your macro."}
{"id":6624,"text":"Now you can run your macro using the Ctrl+K shortcut. This is very fast and easy to configure after you get used to the macro workflow. Figure 363 illustrates the steps involved."}
{"id":6625,"text":"Figure 363: Assigning a shortcut to a macro"}
{"id":6627,"text":"Unfortunately, the Macro Recorder cannot record some actions, and its limitations are related to LibreOffice\u2019s dispatch framework and its relationship to the macro recorder."}
{"id":6629,"text":"The purpose of the dispatch framework is to provide uniform access to components (documents) for commands that generally correspond to menu items. It translates File > Save, the shortcut keys Ctrl+S, or clicking the Save icon on the Standard toolbar into the same \u201cdispatch command.\u201d"}
{"id":6630,"text":"Also, the dispatch framework can send \u201ccommands\u201d back to the user interface (UI). For example, after saving a new document, the framework makes sure that the list of recent files is updated."}
{"id":6631,"text":"A dispatch command is text, for example .uno:InsertObject or .uno:GoToStartOfLine. The command is sent to the document frame and the frame the command around the API until an object is found that can handle the command."}
{"id":6632,"text":"How the macro recorder uses the dispatch framework"}
{"id":6633,"text":"The macro recorder can only register commands generated by the dispatch framework, but not all dispatched commands are complete. For example, inserting an object generates the following code:"}
{"id":6635,"text":"It is not possible to specify what kind of object to create or insert. If an object is inserted from a file, you cannot specify which file to insert."}
{"id":6636,"text":"If while recording a macro you use Tools > Options to open and modify configuration items, the generated macro does not record any configuration changes. In fact, the generated code is commented so it will not even be run."}
{"id":6638,"text":"Though a command is generated when you open a dialog, any work done inside the dialog is not usually recorded. This occurs in places like macro organization dialogs, when you are inserting special characters, and similar types of dialogs. Other possible problems using the macro recorder can occure when you insert a formula, set user data, create filters in Calc, do actions in database forms, and export a document to an encrypted PDF file. You never know for certain what the macro recorder can capture until you try it. For example, the actions from the search dialog are properly captured."}
{"id":6640,"text":"When the macro recorder is not able to solve a specific problem, normally the next steo is to write actual code using the LibreOffice objects. Unfortunately, there is a steep learning curve for these LibreOffice objects. It is usually best to start with simple examples and then increase the scope of macros as you learn more. Learning to read generated macros is a good place to start."}
{"id":6642,"text":"In LibreOffice, macros are grouped in modules, modules are grouped in libraries, and libraries are grouped in library containers. A library is usually used as a major grouping for either an entire category of macros, or for an entire application. Modules usually split functionality, such as user interaction and calculations. Individual macros are subroutines and functions. Figure 364 shows an example of the hierarchical structure of macro libraries in LibreOffice."}
{"id":6644,"text":"Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic to open the Basic Macros dialog (Figure 356 on page 438). All available library containers are shown in the Macro From list and every document is a library container, capable of containing multiple libraries. The application itself acts as two library containers, one container for macros distributed with LibreOffice called LibreOffice Macros, and one container for personal macros called My Macros."}
{"id":6645,"text":"The LibreOffice Macros are stored with the application runtime code, which may not be editable to you unless you have administrator rights in LO. This helps protect these macros because they should not be changed and you should not store your own macros in the LibreOffice Macros container."}
{"id":6646,"text":"Unless your macros are only applicable to a single document, your macros will probably be stored in the My Macros container. The My Macros container is stored in your user area or home directory."}
{"id":6647,"text":"If a macro is contained in a document, then a recorded macro will attempt to work on that document, because it primarily uses ThisComponent for its actions."}
{"id":6648,"text":"Every library container contains a library named Standard. We strongly recommend that you  create your own libraries with meaningful names instead of using the Standard library. Libraries with meaningful names are easier to manage and unlike Standard, your own libraries can be imported into other library containers."}
{"id":6649,"text":"While LibreOffice allows you to import libraries into a library container, it will not allow you to overwrite the library named Standard. Therefore, if you store your macros in the Standard library, you cannot import them into another library container."}
{"id":6650,"text":"Just as it makes good sense to give your libraries meaningful names, you should use meaningful names for your modules. By default, LibreOffice uses names such as Module1, Module2, and so on."}
{"id":6651,"text":"As you create your macros, you must decide where to store them. Macros stored in the application library container named My Macros are globally available to all documents and storing a macro in a document is useful if the document will be shared and you want the macro to be included with the document."}
{"id":6652,"text":"While the Standard and Template libraries are automatically loaded, other library macros are not available until the library that contains them is loaded.  A loaded library is displayed differently from a library that is not loaded. To load the library and the modules it contains, double-click on the library."}

{"id":6669,"text":"Navigate to the directory containing the library to import (Figure 366). Normally you can choose between dialog.xlb and script.xlb. It does not matter which of these two files you select; both will allow your macro to be imported. Macros can be stored in libraries inside LibreOffice documents. To import libraries contained in a document, select a document rather than a directory on disk."}

{"id":6683,"text":"You can run a macro with Tools > Macros > Run, but this will not be efficient when you use macros frequently. Fortunately LibreOffice has many other ways to run your macros."}
{"id":6684,"text":"While you can assign a shortcut to macros, as seen in \u201cRunning a macro\u201d on page 442, you can also link macros to a toolbar icon, menu item, event, or a button embedded in a document. When choosing a method, it is also good to ask questions such as:"}
{"id":6685,"text":"Should the macro be available for only one document or globally for all documents?"}
{"id":6686,"text":"Is the macro for a specific document type, such as a Calc document?"}
{"id":6688,"text":"The answers will determine where to store the macro and how to make it available. For example, you will probably not add a rarely used macro to a toolbar. To help determine your choices, see Table 19."}
{"id":6691,"text":"To add a menu item, keyboard shortcut, or toolbar icon that calls a macro, use the Customize dialog, which allows you to configure menus, keyboard shortcuts, toolbars, and events. To open this dialog, go to Tools > Customize. Use of the Menus, Toolbars, Context Menus, and Keyboard tabs are covered in Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice."}
{"id":6693,"text":"Whenever LibreOffice detects a user action, we call it an event. For example, opening a document, changing status of modified, or moving the mouse cursor are all events. LibreOffice allows events to trigger the execution of a macro; the macro is then called an event handler. Full coverage of event handlers is well beyond the scope of this chapter, but a little knowledge can accomplish much."}
{"id":6694,"text":"Be careful when you configure an event handler. For example, if you write an event handler that is called every time that a document is modified but make a mistake so the event is not properly handled, problems can occur. One possible result is that your event handler will force you to kill LibreOffice."}
{"id":6695,"text":"Go to Tools > Customize to open the Customize dialog and select the Events tab (Figure 368). The events in the Customize dialog are related to the entire application and specific documents."}
{"id":6696,"text":"In the Save In drop-down, select LibreOffice, or a specific document from the menu to save your event."}
{"id":6697,"text":"A common use is to assign the Open Document event to call a specific macro. The macro then performs certain setup tasks for the document. Select the desired event and click Macro to open the Macro Selector dialog (similar to Figure 362 on page 443 but with different action buttons)."}
{"id":6698,"text":"Select the desired macro and click OK to assign the macro to the event. The Events tab will show that the event has been assigned to a macro."}
{"id":6699,"text":"Many objects in a document can be set to call macros when events occur. The most common use is to add a control, such as a button, into a document. Even double-clicking on a graphic opens a dialog with a Macros tab that allows you to assign a macro to an event."}
{"id":6702,"text":"An extension is code that can be installed into LibreOffice to add new functionality. Extensions can be written in almost any programming language and may be simple or sophisticated. Extensions can be grouped into types, for example:"}
{"id":6703,"text":"Calc add-ins, which provide new functionality for Calc, including new functions that act like normal built-in functions."}

{"id":6711,"text":"The examples covered so far in this chapter were created using the macro recorder and the dispatcher, but you can also write macros in code which directly access the objects that comprise LibreOffice. In other words, you can create a macro that directly manipulates a document using more advanced programming logic."}

Values ranging from 50 to 100 should be marked in light green whereas cells with values that are greater than or equal to 0 and less then 50 should be marked in light red. If any values outside the allowed range of 0 to 100 are found, a warning message should be displayed and cells should be marked in light gray."}

{"id":6731,"text":"Since macro programmers frequently need to perform tasks such as creating and opening files, accessing form controls, reading data from databases embedded in Base documents, and so forth, LibreOffice has provided them with the ScriptForge library. This library makes it easier to execute such commands without having to learn the required LibreOffice APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and commands, which may be difficult for casual programmers."}
{"id":6732,"text":"ScriptForge is organized into a set of services, each of which provides methods and properties related to a specific topic. For example, the Dialog service provides access to dialogs available in script modules and the Database service allows to execute SQL commands in Base documents. The example in Listing 6 shows a macro written in Basic using the ScriptForge library that opens a Calc document, creates a new sheet named NewSheet, and inserts the string \u201cHello\u201d into cell A1.
